    <string name="addText1">When adding lots of numbers together it is helpful to write them in columns, denoting units, tens and hundreds. If we needed to add 4, 15, 23, 24, 35, 42</string>
    <string name="addText2">Step 1: Arrange the numbers in columns, Hundreds, Tens and Units as needed:</string>
    <string name="addText3">Add the numbers in the right (units) column. This should give you an answer of 23. Two tens and three units.  Write a 3 in the your total for the units column.</string>
    <string name="addText4">Carry over the 2 tens - it is usual to put this number underneath the total, we\'ll need it in the next step.</string>
    <string name="addText5">Step 2: Add together the numbers in the tens column remembering to include the 2 that was carried over.  You should get an an answer of 14.</string>
    <string name="addText6">That is 4 tens (as we are working in the tens column) and 1 to carry over to the next column, hundreds.</string>
    <string name="addText7">Step 3: Add together the numbers in the tens column, remembering to include the 2 that was carried over. You should get an an answer of 14.</string>
    <string name="addText8">That is 4 tens (as we are working in the tens column) and 1 to carry over to the next column, hundreds.</string>
    <string name="addText9">There are no numbers in the hundreds column except for the 1 that was carried over from the tens column.

As there is nothing else to add bring the one up to the total.

We have no numbers left to add and therefore have arrived at our answer: 143.</string>
